      <h2 class="sub_title_font color3">What is <em class="color2 disription_title">data science</em> ?</h2>
      <p class="disription color4">Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and
        techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions.
        Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.Mathematical models
        enable you to make quick calculations and predictions based on what you already know about the data.
        Modeling is also a part of Machine Learning and involves identifying which algorithm is the most suitable to solve a given problem
        and how to train these models.</p>

      <h2 class="sub_title_font color3">Why <em class="color2 disription_title">data science</em> ?</h2>
      <p class="disription color4">Data creates magic. Industries need data to help them make careful decisions. Data Science churns raw data into
        meaningful insights. Therefore, industries need data science. A Data Scientist is a wizard who knows how to create magic using data.
        A skilled Data Scientist will know how to dig out meaningful information with whatever data he comes across. He helps the company in
        the right direction. The company requires strong data-driven decisions at which he’s an expert. The Data Scientist is an expert in various
        underlying fields of Statistics and Computer Science. He uses his analytical aptitude to solve business problems.</p>
