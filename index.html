      <h2 class="sub_title_font color3">What is <em class="color2 disription_title">data science</em> ?</h2>
      <p class="disription color4">Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and
        techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions.
        Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.Mathematical models
        enable you to make quick calculations and predictions based on what you already know about the data.
        Modeling is also a part of Machine Learning and involves identifying which algorithm is the most suitable to solve a given problem
        and how to train these models.</p>

      <h2 class="sub_title_font color3">Why <em class="color2 disription_title">data science</em> ?</h2>
      <p class="disription color4">Data creates magic. Industries need data to help them make careful decisions. Data Science churns raw data into
        meaningful insights. Therefore, industries need data science. A Data Scientist is a wizard who knows how to create magic using data.
        A skilled Data Scientist will know how to dig out meaningful information with whatever data he comes across. He helps the company in
        the right direction. The company requires strong data-driven decisions at which he’s an expert. The Data Scientist is an expert in various
        underlying fields of Statistics and Computer Science. He uses his analytical aptitude to solve business problems.</p>

          Data science is not only helping businesses make better decisions but is also helping them to find new opportunities. Data Science is also helping
          businesses to know their customers more closely so that they can serve them better. Data Scientists are the superheroes of today's businesses, who
          collect, cleanse, and organize the data using their intense skills. Data Science has the power to transform industries and our society. Data
          Science gives meaning to raw data and converts it into meaningful insights that can be used to grow the business and recognize market trends. With
          so less supply of specialized Data Scientists and a rapid demand, Data Science has become a lucrative career. Aspirants who want to choose Data
          Science as a career will need a lot of work hard and commitment as it's a very technical subject. However, its rewards are even greater.
